# profile-pic
This was an Image Processing project that I used to generate my profile pic when my profile picture was this, it runs using the users webcam:</br></br>
![A Canny Edge Detector Image of a man holding a phone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukemccartney/profile-pic/master/pp.png "Profile Picture")
</br></br>The project uses [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and runs until the user decides to terminate the program.
