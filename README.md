# profile-pic
This was an Image Processing project that I used to generate my profile pic when my profile picture was this, it runs using the users webcam:</br></br>
![A Canny Edge Detector Image of a man holding a phone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukemccartney/profile-pic/master/pp.png "Profile Picture")
</br></br>The project uses [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and runs until the user decides to terminate the program.
<br>
## To run
Open up a terminal environment (preferably Linux or MacOS) and run the following:<br><br>
`pip install opencv-python`<br>
`pip install numpy`<br>
`python3 profile-pic.py`<br><br>
If you haven't got Python or Pip installed then you will have to do that first, as a Mac user I prefer to use [homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python), which should install Pip as well, but if not you can install Python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
<br><br>
Pip documentation can be found [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
